- Accent color: Electric purple (#BE34DE) to add vibrant highlights, analogous to the primary, yet standing out with a shift in brightness and saturation.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif for headlines and shorter text, creating a techy feel.
- Use astral-themed icons for menu items and interactive elements.
- Ensure a clean, responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes with a focus on space-themed visuals.
- Implement smooth and seamless animations for transitions between sections and interactive elements using a library like Rive. Design these animations in a way that is evocative of cosmic motion and transformation.
